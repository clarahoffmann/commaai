Sometimes tfrecords files can be corrupted if there occurs 
an error somewhere during writing the tfrecords file. 
This can be visible when training the DNN fails.
If this seems to be the case, the corrupted tfrecords file can be found using
the 'check_corrupted_file.ipynb'. 
The corrupted file can just be deleted.
